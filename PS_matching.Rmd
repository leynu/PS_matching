# GOAL

## **Hopefully give you some intuitional understanding of Propensity score (matching)**


---

# Our hypothetical example

- Suppose UN supports a program to build *High Schools* in poor cities in Nigeria, Africa

- The aim was to reduce *Teen Pregnancies*

- `T` - treatment variable
    - `T=1` - a city that got a new high school
    - `T=0` - a city that didn't 
  
- The cities were not selected at random 

- `BR` - Birth rate, our outcome of interest
  - The birth rate is measured in babies born to women aged 15–19 years per 1000 women, approximately two years after the high schools opened.

---

# How did the program affect teen pregnancies?

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(cases) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16)
```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(control) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16)
```

- Compare the average birth rate in the 'treatment' city to that in the control city.

--

$$\frac{10+15+22+19}{4}- \frac{25+19+4+8+6}{5} = 4.1$$
- Birth rate did *increase*?! 

---
# What/why?

- Cities that got the high schools almost certainly had *high $\Uparrow$ BR before the program* was implemented
- If we had some information about the *pre-program BR*

  - We could have compared changes in the BR in the treatment group versus the changes in the control group
  
  - BUT suppose we don't have that information

- Our two samples may differ in terms of other factors, other than the fact that they were 'treated'

> **Selection bias (SB)**  
> Individuals who experience a certain treatment often vary from individuals who don't recieved the treatment 

- *4.1* reflects both the *effect of treatment* and some degree of *SB*

- A problem in any *observational studies*
  
---
# In a perfect world 

- We need to get the two groups to look as similar as possible
  - so that we can isolate the effect of 'treatment' (exposure)
 
- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)**
  - Is the most powerful tool in order to achieve that
  
  - Provides groups comparable with respect of known and unknown confounders (variables)
  
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IukZ771bIyeJcS4/giphy.gif)

- *Cities were not selected at random!*

---
# Additional information available to us ...

- Two variables: 
  - `povrate` - Poverty rate in the cities
  - `teachers` - The number of teachers per capita before the program was implemented 

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(cases2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16)

kable(control2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16)
```
--

- *Take a moment to compare the treatment and control groups using those 2 variables *


---
# Observed information ...

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(cases2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16)

kable(control2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16)
```

- On average the treatment group have 

  - higher poverty rate `r mean(cases2$povrate)` (`r mean(control2$povrate)`) and 
  
  - fewer teachers per capita `r mean(cases2$teachers)` (`r mean(control2$teachers)`)


---
# We need to get the two groups to look as similar as possible

### The basic idea

1. *Create a new control group*

  - For each observation in the treatment group, 
  - select the control observation that looks most like it - based on the variables

2. *Compute the treatment effect*

  - Compare the average outcome in the treatment group with the average outcome in the new control group


---
# Lets try with just one variable

- In a real study, you will have more cases and controls

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_1)

control2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(2, background = my_col_1)
```

  row_spec(1, background = my_col_1) %>%
  row_spec(2, background = my_col_2) 

control2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(2, background = my_col_1) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_2) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases2 %>%

  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_1) %>%
  row_spec(2:4, background = my_col_2) 

control2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(2, background = my_col_1) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_2) 
```

- city *1* -> city *6*
- city *2* -> city *5*
- city *3* -> city *5*
- city *4* -> city *5*
  - Using the same controls *many* times - Not unusual!

---
# Lets try with just one variable

- In a real study, you will have more cases and controls

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(c(2, 4), background = my_col_2) 

control2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(2, background = my_col_2)
```


- city *6* could have been matched to multiple treatment observations 
  - city *2*
  - city *4*
  - No exact match but may still be 👌

---

# Lets try with just one variable

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_1) %>%
  row_spec(2:4, background = my_col_2) 

control2 %>%
  select(-teachers) %>%
  kable() %>%

  row_spec(2, background = my_col_1) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_2) %>%
  row_spec(3:5, background = my_col_3)

```

- Many control observations (city *7*-*9*) might not match to any treatment observations 
    - They have much lower poverty rates 

---
# Multiple background characteristics

- *Gets a lot more complicated! *
- city 1: Should we match it with city 5?

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases2 %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_1)  

control2 %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_1) 
```

---
# Multiple background characteristics

- *Gets a lot more complicated! *
- city 1: Should we match it with city 5? or city 6?

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases2 %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(1, background = my_col_1)  

control2 %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T, position = "left", font_size = 16) %>%
  row_spec(2, background = my_col_1) 
```

- Which variable was more important for WHO 🤷?

# Propensity score calculation

- Use **logistic regression** to estimate all the needed $\beta$ coefficients

$$ P(T=1 \text{  |  } povrate \text{ & } teachers) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times povrate + \beta_2 \times teachers$$
```{r}
pscores.model <- glm(T ~ povrate + teachers, # the model
                     family = binomial(link='logit'), #logistic regression
                     data = data) # our data set
```

The calculated coefficients

```{r echo=FALSE}
# The calculated coefficients
pscores.model$coefficients
```

--

$$ P(T=1 \text{  |  } povrate \text{ & } teachers) = -7.45 + 14.50 \times povrate -0.09 \times teachers$$

Use the equation to compute the *predicted probability of treatment* using the background characteristics

# Propensity score

$$ P(T=1 \text{  |  } povrate \text{ & } teachers) = -7.45 + 14.50 \times povrate -0.09 \times teachers$$

- Similar poverty rate `r mean(ps_data_t1$povrate)` (`r mean(ps_data_t2$povrate)`) and 

- Same number teachers per capita `r mean(ps_data_t1$teachers)` (`r mean(ps_data_t2$teachers)`)

** What was the effect of treatment on BR?**

--

$$\frac{10+15+22+19}{4}- \frac{25+19+19+19}{4} = -4$$

- The effect of constructing new high schools has led to an average birth rate reduction of 4 babies per 1000 women

# lalonde

- The National Supported Work Demonstration (NSW) was a temporary employment program designed to help disadvantaged workers move into the labor market 


```{r include=FALSE}
#Now load the lalonde data (which is in the MatchIt package):
data(lalonde)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}

- `r table(lalonde$treat)[2]` cases and `r table(lalonde$treat)[1]` controls

- *We want to evaluate the effect of the NSW program on income*

---
# Look at the data *BEFORE* matching

- **Standardized differences (smd) ** to check covariate balance

- For continous variables: 
  - e.g. *age*, *educ* - the number of years of schooling
  
  - the difference in means between groups, divided by the (pooled) standard deviation
  
$$smd = \frac{\bar{X}_{treatment} -  \bar{X}_{control}}{ \sqrt{ \frac{s^2_{treatment} -s^2_{control}}{2}}}$$

> Rules of thumb:   
>   - values *< 0.1* indicate adequate balance  
>   - value *0.1 - 0.2* are not too alarming  
>   - *> 0.2* indicate serious imbalance  

---

# SMD before matching

- *re78* - is excluded since it is out outcome variable of interest
- *429* controls versus *185* treated patients


```{r echo=FALSE}
xvars <- c("age", "educ", "black", "hispan", "married", "nodegree", "re74", "re75")
table1 <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars,
  strata = "treat",
  data = lalonde,
  test = FALSE)

print(table1, smd = TRUE)
```

     
- 👎🚫 *Imbalance!!!* 🚫️👎️
  - A large difference in covariate distribution
  
  - We need balance! $\Rightarrow$ let's do  *PS matching*

---
# Matching methods

- *Exact match*? 
  - We may not find cases/controls with the same PS
  
- *Greedy (nearest-neighbor) matching*
  - As soon as a match is made between two objects that match is kept even if a 'better' match could be found in the data
  - Tries to include as many cases as possible 
  - Trade-offs: No perfect balance in covariates!
  
- *Caliper matching*
  - Matches two subjects within a given range (**caliper**)
  
- *Optimal matching*
  - The algorithm is able to reconsider a match
  - Is going to minimize the total distance 
  - Involve a lot of computation

---
# Matching methods

- *One-to-one matching*


- *One-to-many matching*
  - One case is matched with several controls
  - Useful if you have a large control group

--

- *without* replacement
    - ones a match has been made those subjects can not be used ones again
- *with* replacement
    - the same control subject can be matched to several cases 


---
# Step 1: Calculate PS

- Use a logistic regression model, where the outcome is *treatment*

- Include the 8 confounding variables in the model as predictors

```{r}
# fit a PS model - logistic regression
psmodel <- glm(treat ~ age + educ + black + hispan + married #<<
                           + nodegree + re74 + re75, #<<
  family = binomial(),
  data = lalonde)
lalonde$pscore <- psmodel$fitted.values
head(lalonde[, c(1:9,11)])
```

---

# Step 2: Examine PS values *BEFORE* matching 

.pull-left[

```{r echo=FALSE}

ggplot(lalonde, aes(x=pscore, fill=as.factor(treat))) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.4) +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = " ", labels = c("Control", "Treatment")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1))

```

]

.pull-right[

- Cases may be excluded!
  - The price we have to pay for matching 
  
- Cases with extrem PS values
  - *very high PS*, close to *1* 
  - *very low PS*, close to *0*

]

---

#Step 3: Do the matching

- 1:1 matching
- without replacement
- no caliper

```{r, highlight.output=c(6,7), echo=FALSE}
psmatch <- Matching::Match(Tr = lalonde$treat,
  M = 1,
  X = lalonde$pscore,
  replace = FALSE)

matched <- lalonde[unlist(psmatch[c("index.treated", "index.control")]), ]

matchedtab1 <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars,
  strata = "treat",
  data = matched,
  test = FALSE)

print(matchedtab1, smd = TRUE)
```

- *185* cases and *185* controls

- 👎💩 *Still looks bad!!* 💩👎️

---
# Re-do the matching!

- 1:1 matching
- without replacement
- *caliper = 0.1*

```{r, highlight.output=c(11), echo=FALSE}

set.seed(931139)
psmatch2 <- Matching::Match(Tr = lalonde$treat,
  M = 1,
  X = lalonde$pscore,
  replace = FALSE,
  caliper = 0.1)

matched2 <- lalonde[unlist(psmatch2[c("index.treated", "index.control")]), ]

matchedtab2 <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars,
  strata = "treat",
  data = matched2,
  test = FALSE)

print(matchedtab2, smd = TRUE)

```

- *111* cases and *111* controls
- 👍️ *Not perfect but much better!* 👍️

- *Overt (measured) bias* would occur if you had imbalance and you carried out your outcome analysis anyway

---

# 2nd matching attempt

- 1:1 matching
- without replacement
- *caliper = 0.1*

```{r, highlight.output=c(11), echo=FALSE}

psmatch3 <- Matching::Match(Tr = lalonde$treat,
  M = 1,
  X = lalonde$pscore,
  replace = FALSE,
  caliper = 0.1)

matched3 <- lalonde[unlist(psmatch3[c("index.treated", "index.control")]), ]

matchedtab3 <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars,
  strata = "treat",
  data = matched3,
  test = FALSE)

print(matchedtab3, smd = TRUE)

```



```{r ,eval=FALSE}
warning("Do NOT play with the data!")
```
  
---

# Step 4: Compare PS after matching

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
# Use semi-transparent fill
ggplot(matched2, aes(x=pscore, fill=as.factor(treat))) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.4)+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = " ", labels = c("Control", "Treatment")) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1))

```

---

# Step 5: Carry out the outcome analysis

- If out matching algorithm has done a good job!
  - We have *balance* in our covariates 
  - Compare *re78* - real earnings in 1978 - in the treatment group versus the control group

```{r}
lm_model1 <- lm(re78 ~ treat,  data = matched2) #<<
tidy(lm_model1)
```

- *p-values = 0.141*, we have no evidence that ** NSW program had any effect on income **

---

# Traditional covariate adjustment

- *Add all covaraies into the model*
  - Using the original data 

```{r, highlight.output=c(5, 7, 12, 13)}
lm_model2 <- lm(re78 ~ treat + age + educ + black + hispan +  
                       married + nodegree + re74 + re75,  data = lalonde)
tidy(lm_model2)
```

- **POS** - Shows you the effect of *all* covariates not just the *treatment*
- **NEG** - May not be suitable with many covariates in small studies

---
# PS covariate adjustment

- Use of PS as the only covariate in the model
- Alternative methods are available - adding all covariates + PS

```{r}
lm_model3 <- lm(re78 ~ treat + pscore, data = matched2) #<<

tidy(lm_model3)
```

- We have no evidence of treatment effect!

---

# Doubly robust methods 

- *Controll for unbalanced covariates*
  - *re75* - real earnings in 1975 in dollars

```{r, highlight.output=c(6)}
lm_model4 <- lm(re78 ~ treat + re75, data = matched2) #<<

tidy(lm_model4)
```

- We have no evidence of treatment effect!

class: inverse, middle, center

### What we estimated is NOT the average treatment effect but the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). 
### Our conclusions can only be generalised to cases that look like the treatment group   

---

# Limitations: Hidden bias

### We can only expect to achieve balance on *observed*  variables

> **Hidden bias** 
> would occur if there is *imbalance* on *unobserved* variables and
> these unobserved variables are actually confounders

- We still have to worry about the possibility that our observations differ on other *unobserved* ways that we haven't accounted for by the PS 

---

# Advantages and disadvantages of PS matching

### POS
- Provides excellent covariate balance in most circumstances
- Simple to analyse, present and interpret

### NEG

- Some patients are unmatched $\Rightarrow$ important information being excluded from the analysis
- Matching tended to give less precise estimates in some cases

---

# Sensitivity analysis 

- We typically believe that there is some degree of *unmeasured confounding* 🙈

### Are the conclusions we're making *sensitive* to just *minor violations* of our key assumption or is it *very sensitive* to *violations*


For example:
  - *Change from statistically significant to not*
    - How much hidden bias would they have to be before we would *not* have a significant result?

  - *Change in direction of effect*
    - How much bias would there have to be before the sign actually changed?


---

### Propensity score methods are NOT necessarily superior to conventional covariate adjustment,   and care should be taken to select the most suitable method.
